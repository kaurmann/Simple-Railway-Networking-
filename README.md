# Simple Railway Networking

This project is a simulated railway network built using CCNA concepts and principles. It was developed as part of my graduation coursework to demonstrate the application of networking knowledge in a real-world scenario.

## Objective
To design a functional and secure communication network for a multi-station railway system using networking tools and Cisco concepts.

## Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer (or similar simulation platform)
- Static and Dynamic IP Routing
- Subnetting
- Switch and Router Configuration
- LAN/WAN setup

## Key Features
- Multiple stations connected over a structured network
- Assigned IP schemes for each node
- Proper routing protocols configured for end-to-end communication
- Error-free simulation using CCNA-level configurations

## Learning Outcome
- Practical understanding of networking fundamentals
- Application of subnetting, routing, and switch configuration
- Experience in designing secure, scalable IT infrastructure models
